# HomeRuns


I Used MLB's statistics API to create a tracker for a fantasy baseball league I was in with some friends. 
We wanted to play fantasy baseball where only home runs counted, however none of the main fantasy platforms had that option, so I created a python script to track our teams home runs and exported it into a csv file.
